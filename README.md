# slack-repo

A DNF/YUM repository for installing Slack on RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora Linux.

You can use the slack-repo RPM from [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rocketraman/slack-repo/) or you can drop the slack.repo file from this repository into `/etc/yum.repos.d` to enable it. From there, you can run `sudo dnf install slack` or `sudo yum install slack` to install the Slack for Linux client from Slack's [packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack/) yum repository to enjoy automatic GPG verified RPM package updates.

### Why should I use this repository?

Slack doesn't offer an official repo to use off of their Linux download page. This makes updating the Slack Linux client a manual process, with zero automatic GPG check on the RPM package you are about to install. Also, the install [instructions](https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack/install#bash-rpm) on their packagecloud account will give you a repository for automatic package updates, but it uses an invalid GPG key which is less than helpful.

TL;DR: Having automatic Slack for Linux package updates and verifying the GPG signature on the RPM are possible if you use this repo. Yayy!

sudo dnf copr enable rocketraman/slack-repo
